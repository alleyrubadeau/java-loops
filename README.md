//COMMENT YOUR CODE FOR HUMANS

Variables are called variable because they can vary over time. 

BLOCKS-series of steps we need to go through to complete the “transaction”
var rent=1700;
{
rent=rent*12;
console.log(rent);
}

CONDITIONALS-“if” and sometimes “else” and usually returns a true or false
var lunch break=60;
var yoga class=75;

IF (class<break){
console.log(“go to yoga class”);
}

if (these make decisions) condition isn't true——
ELSE {
console.log(“you don't have enough time alley”);
}

ITERATION-each time a loop block executes 

FUNCTIONS=====can be called by name and the function will run inside of it.

SCOPE-if a variable is defined inside the function it is only relevant in that particular function’s scope.

On the flip side…if you declare something on the “GLOBAL” scope level you can have access to it throughout entire program.  
****FYI you want to “scope” your variables within the function to keep it organized they they are not “running wild”*****

TAKEAWAYS FROM THE AUTHOR

You need operators to perform actions on
You need values and types to perform different kinds of actions like math on numbers or output with strings.
You need variables to store data (aka state) during your program's execution.
You need conditionals like if statements to make decisions.
You need loops to repeat tasks until a condition stops being true.
You need functions to organize your code into logical and reusable chunks.
